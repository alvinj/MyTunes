My Tunes
========

This is a small GUI application that lets you play an audio file. I use it to play
audio files that contain "binaural beats" while I play songs from iTunes, Spotify,
Pandora, or some other source at the same time.

The code here is crap; I wrote it a long time ago when I only had a few free hours
per week (or month) to write any code, so it's all kind of cobbled together.

That being said, if you want to play a sound file using Java, Scala, Groovy, or
some other JVM-based language, I hope something in here is helpful.
